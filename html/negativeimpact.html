    <h1>Negative Impact</h1><br>
    <p>Research on task significance and relational job design suggests that information from beneficiaries of one’s work 
    fosters perceptions of impact, and thus improved work outcomes. This paper presents results from a longitudinal field 
    experiment examining the effect of another strategy for fostering perceptions of impact – engaging employees in regular
    reflection about how their work benefits others. With a sample of professionals from multiple organizations, this longitudinal
    study examined the effect on job performance and work-life conflict of both positive and negative impact reflection. Results 
    show that negative impact reflection had a pronounced negative effect on job performance, but no effect on work-life conflict. 
    Positive impact reflection had a weak positive effect on work-life conflict, but no significant effect on job performance. 
    The direction of effects seen in the no intervention condition mirrored that of the negative impact reflection condition, 
    suggesting a possible buffering effect for positive impact reflection. This research provides empirical and theoretical 
    contributions to the literatures on relational job design and task significance.</p>
